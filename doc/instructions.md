Recommended to run this program from the command line as it is faster than doing it from a Jupyter notebook.

1) make sure that the elemental composition of the lignin you would like to model is in the file /data/elementalanalysis.dat.  If it is not, you must add it first
2) Use generate_bash_script or your own code to generate the script to run the model.
3) run ligpyr.py
