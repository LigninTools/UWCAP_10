Docstrings for ligpy modules
****************************
Included below are the docstrings for most of the modules and functions
included in ligpy.  Three modules are not included here but are well
documented in the source code:

1. ``generate_bash_script`` : this is a customized module for my hardware and
software environment at the University of Washington.  Future users will need
to modify this to suit their own systems.

2. ``ligpy.py`` : this module coordinates the solving of the kinetic model by
interacting with all the other modules in the program, but does not contain any
functions of its own to document.

3. ``revisions_to_faravelli.py`` : this module was included just for reference,
it shows the changes we made from the kinetic scheme that we modified to
develop our scheme, but it should not need to be used in the future.
